I'm Geeki, passionate about exploring new technologies and things, always keeping a learning mindset.\n\nI can speak Mandarin, Cantonese, and basic English.\n\nBeyond programming, I'm also passionate about traveling. I've road-tripped across Xinjiang, Yunnan, and Guangxi in China - quite the experienced driver! Internationally, I've traveled with family or solo to Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and other countries.\nI enjoy street dancing (popping), love music (a piano beginner...), and watching movies.\nRecommended films: Interstellar, Good Will Hunting, The Truman Show.\nCurrently diving into reading. Recommended books: Conversations with God, The Power of Now, How to Read a Book.",
